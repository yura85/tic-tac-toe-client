Depvelopment process
In begining i try to stick to plan what i have made, but unfortunately  i stuck on the game logic part.
And after that i deviated from my plan. And i jump to the user authentication part wich looked the easeast
to me.
Than i come back to game logic and in the same time i started geme events part. That time where methodical process and clean code stopped. And to the last day i was working on the game events and game API.
I didn't have time to do UI.
Dry code
unfortunately my code is not dry it have some parts that need to be refactor.
Keep code modular
I try to commit often and don't work in the master branch.
Creative spin
In the future i w'd like to add some style to my project.
Additional features
In the future i w'd like to add option to play vs computer
