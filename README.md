Depvelopment process
In begining i try to stick to plan what i have made but unfortunately  i stuck on the game logic part.
And after that i deviated from my plan. And i jump to the user authentication part wich looked the easeast
to me.
Than i come back to game logic and in the same time i started geme events part. That time where methodical process and clean code stopped. And to the last day i was working on the game events and game API.
I didn't have time to do UI.
Cleaner code
After i deviated from my prpject plan

Planing process

I try to stick to the project requirements so i breaked it on to small parts
---First i did my wireframe -- https://imgur.com/a/w8QiCtK
---Second i create users stories
user1 - as a student, i want to play tic tac toe game when i'm bord
user2 - as person who likes to play i want to play some simple game like tic tac stories
user3 - as a developer a want to create a game with logic
user4 - -as a person who take a comuter i want to play a game during my trips
game play:
1- wellcome page, sign up and login
2- game bord
3- game logic
4- win or losse message
5- see have meny game did you played
6- start a new game or log out
---Then i did html file and user authentication with API interaction
--- next i bild game logic
--- the game API interaction was the hardest part for me wich took a lot of my time.
--- then UI and refactoring part. unfortunately i dad not have enough time to do it so my app doesn't look nice
