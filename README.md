Planing process

I try to stick to the project requirements so i breaked it on to small parts

---First i did my wireframe -- https://imgur.com/a/w8QiCtK

---Second i create users stories

user1 - as a student, i want to play tic tac toe game when i'm bord

user2 - as person who likes to play i want to play some simple game like tic tac stories

user3 - as a developer a want to create a game with logic

user4 - -as a person who take a comuter i want to play a game during my trips

game play:

1- wellcome page, sign up and login

2- game bord

3- game logic

4- win or losse message

5- see have meny game did you played

6- start a new game or log out

---Then i did html file and user authentication with API interaction

--- next i bild game logic

--- the game API interaction was the hardest part for me wich took a lot of my time.

--- then UI and refactoring part. unfortunately i dad not have enough time to do it so my app doesn't look nice

Dry code

unfortunately my code is not dry it have some parts that need to be refactor.

Keep code modular

I try to commit often and don't work in the master branch.

Creative spin

In the future i w'd like to add some style to my project.

Additional features

In the future i w'd like to add option to play vs computer

Conclusion

I really enjoined bilding my first application. The most difficult was the game API.
